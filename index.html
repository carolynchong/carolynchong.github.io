		<h1>Carolyn Chong</h1>
		<p>I am a Product Manager.</p>
		<p>I lived in Hamilton.</p>
		<p>I moved to San Francisco.</p>
		<p>I now live in Montr&eacute;al.</p>
		<p>I have four delightful brothers and a basset hound named Bramble.</p>
		<p>I love smiles on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7sAkmfVgbo">kids learning to code</a>.</p>
		<p>I have spent summers learning about life from <a href="http://campoutlook.ca/volunteer.htm">at-risk youth</a> in the Canadian outdoors.</p>
		<p>I did a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_Arts_and_Science">liberal arts degree</a> because there is so much I don't know</a>.</p>
		<p>I did a second major in Computer Science.</p>
		<p>I <a href="https://github.com/carolynchong">wrote code</a>, then led Product at <a href="https://www.obie.ai">Obie.ai</a>, and we got into <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a>.</p>
		<p>I wrote some <a href="https://medium.com/@carolynchong">words</a> for them, too.</p>
		<p>I was a Product Owner at <a href="https://www.elementai.com">Element AI</a> and worked with really smart folks.</p>
		<p>I built natural language search products at both companies.</p>
		<p>I am not anymore, but both are still awesome.</p>
		<p>I have had the pleasure of speaking at some cool <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisbuttenham/status/936993774957449216">conferences</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CesareDiDonato/status/879803792623054850">panels</a>.</p>
		<p>I am obsessed with words and the power of conversational interfaces.</p>
		<p>I know there is no problem that empathy cannot solve.</p>
		<p>I am on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynchong/">LinkedIn</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
		<p>I can also be found petting your dog.</p>
